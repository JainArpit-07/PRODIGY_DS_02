## Titanic Dataset: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

## Overview
Second task of Prodigy InfoTech m1 Data  Science intership
This project is dedicated to performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset.


The primary goals of this project are to:

1. Clean and preprocess the dataset to handle missing values and outliers.
2. Conduct exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the relationships between variables.
3. Identify patterns and trends in the data that may be useful for further analysis or modeling.

## Dataset
The Titanic dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle and is available at the following link: [Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data)

## Results

*   Chance of female survival is higher than male survival
*   Travelling in Pclass 3 was the deadliest
*   People going to C survived more
*   People in the age range 20 to 40 had a higher chance of not surviving
*   People traveling with smaller families had a higher chance of surviving the accident in comparison to people with large families and traveling alone
